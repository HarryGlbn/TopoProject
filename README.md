# TopoProject
An algorithm to compute the dual (marked) Thurston unit ball given an element of the mapping class group and a curve on the surface of the 2-torus.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Firstly you will need to install the python modules (can be found by google-searching):

scipy

shapely

matplotlib

The generators of the mapping class group are called a, A, ..., d, D where a, b, c, d are the usual generators and the 
capitalisation indicates inversion. 

The curve on the surface is to be input as a word in x, X, y, Y, w, W, z, Z
where these generators are as in the literature you gave me, and again capitalisation indicates inversion.

To produce the dual unit ball, you will use the MCG_to_unitball function. This takes two arguments. The first is the element of the MCG that you want to use to deform your curve. Input this in the form [A, c, D, ...] where this represents the word AcD in the MCG.
The second is the surface curve that you want to deform. Input this in the form [x, y, X, Y, ...] where this would represent the word xyXY.


To produce the MARKED dual unit ball, you use the DualWithMarked function. The inputs work the same way as before. The only 
reason I have left the MCG_to_unitball function in is that it runs much faster for some large examples I tested.
